A dead-simple **Bootstrap static site generator** with great flexibility and control.

Main advantages:
- Minimum magic - maximum transparency
- Total control of the generation process

**Symply** is based on well-known fast and reliable [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) templating engine.

Great for personal sites, landing pages and other small projects where you **want to be in control of everything**.

## Installation

`npm -g install symply`

## Quick Start

symply init # generate file structure

symply generate
```
